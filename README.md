# Overview

The software I developed is a comprehensive finance tracker application. This project allowed me to explore the robust features of TypeScript, particularly around type safety and enhanced code readability and maintainability. My aim was to create a practical application that not only solidifies my understanding of TypeScript but also provides real-world utility.

The purpose behind this software was to challenge myself with a project that would require a nuanced understanding of TypeScript's features, such as interfaces and type annotations, and to see how they integrate with a modern JavaScript framework like React.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following tools and technologies:

* Visual Studio Code: An efficient and feature-rich code editor.
* Node.js: As the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, coupled with TypeScript for type safety.
* TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript, adding static type definitions.

# Future Work

There are several areas where I plan to extend and enhance the application:

1- User Authentication: Implementing user accounts and secure authentication.
2- Data Persistence: Introducing database integration for long-term data storage.
3- Mobile Responsiveness: Ensuring the application is fully responsive for mobile users.
